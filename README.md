# VisionAlgorithmsForMobileRobotics
Code exercises for the course Vision Algorithms for Mobile Robotics @ UZH

cameraProjection - In this exercise points are projected in the camera plane given known world coordinates. Additionally, the distortion of the lens is considered and based on the coefficients the image is undisorted using bilinear interpolation. Finally, an augmented reality cube is plotted.

cameraCalibration - Implementation of the DLT algorithm
